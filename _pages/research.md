## üåü What I Do

I aim to build **intelligent navigation systems** that enable robots to operate autonomously in complex, unstructured environments.

---

## üî¨ Research Themes
* ***Deep Learning & Reinforcement Learning for Autonomous Robot Navigation***
Developing learning-based approaches for robot perception, planning, and control that enable adaptive navigation in dynamic environments.
* ***AI-driven Decision-Making for Robot Motion Planning and Control***
Leveraging AI methods to enhance decision-making across motion planning and control.
* ***LLMs and VLMs for Low-Level Decision-Making in Robot Navigation***
Investigating how LLMs and VLMs can be used for **direct low-level decision-making** in robot navigation.

## üöÄ Future Work: Legged & Humanoid Navigation
My future research focuses on **navigation** for legged robots, including **locomotion** (gait generation and motor control).
**Next challenges:**
- Quadruped climbing and navigation on non-planar terrain
- Humanoid robots: climbing obstacles and dynamic balance
