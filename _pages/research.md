## üåü What I Do

I aim to build **intelligent navigation systems** that enable robots to operate autonomously in complex, unstructured environments.

---

## üî¨ Research Themes
* ***Deep Learning & Reinforcement Learning for Autonomous Robot Navigation***
Developing learning-based approaches for robot perception, planning, and control that enable adaptive navigation in dynamic environments.
* ***AI-driven Decision-Making for Robot Motion Planning and Control***
Leveraging AI methods to enhance decision-making across motion planning and control.
* ***LLMs and VLMs for Low-Level Decision-Making in Robot Navigation***
Investigating how LLMs and VLMs can be used for **direct low-level decision-making** in robot navigation.

## üöÄ Future Work: Legged & Humanoid Navigation
My future research focuses on **navigation** for legged robots, including **locomotion** (gait generation and motor control).
**Next challenges:**
- Quadruped climbing and navigation on non-planar terrain
- Humanoid robots: climbing obstacles and dynamic balance

## ü§ñ Hardware Platforms

I work with diverse robot platforms to validate algorithms in both simulation and real-world environments.

| **Unitree Go1** | <img src="/images/go1.png" width="180"/> | Quadruped | Visual‚ÄìLiDAR fusion, RL locomotion |
| **Unitree Go2** | <img src="/images/go2.png" width="180"/> | Quadruped | VLM navigation, cross-modal perception |
| **Unitree G1** | <img src="/images/G1.png" width="180"/> | Humanoid | LLM-guided policy learning |

## üõ†Ô∏è Simulation Environments

I design and use multiple simulation platforms for both classical planning and learning-based navigation.

| Environment | Image | Description |
|:-------------|:------:|:------------|
| **Gazebo** | <img src="/images/gazebo.png" width="300"/> | Classic ROS-based simulator for wheeled robots, supporting costmaps, sensor fusion, and realistic physics. |
| **Isaac Gym** | <img src="/images/isaacgym.png" width="300"/> | GPU-accelerated simulation for large-scale reinforcement learning and policy optimization. |
| **Isaac Sim** | <img src="/images/isaacsim.png" width="300"/> | High-fidelity NVIDIA Omniverse simulator for perception, dynamics, and multi-robot coordination. |
| **Custom Terrains** | <img src="/images/terrian.png" width="300"/> | Procedurally generated terrains for testing locomotion, stability, and adaptive control. |
| **Self-design Simulation** | <img src="/images/simulation.png" width="300"/> | self-design simulation using C++ for motion planning or multi-goal motion planning. |
