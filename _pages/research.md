## 🌟 What I Do

I aim to build **intelligent navigation systems** that enable robots to operate autonomously in complex, unstructured environments.

---

## 🔬 Research Themes

* ***Foundation Models for Intelligent Decision-Making***  
Developing LLM and VLM-based systems for adaptive reasoning and planning. Focusing on prompt engineering, fine-tuning with domain-specific data, and real-time inference optimization for sequential decision-making tasks.

* ***Deep Reinforcement Learning for Adaptive Control***  
Designing model-free and hierarchical RL algorithms for continuous control problems. Investigating policy learning, reward shaping, and sim-to-real transfer methods for deployment in complex, dynamic environments.

* ***Learning-based Motion Planning***  
Creating neural planning methods that leverage learned representations for efficient path generation. Developing learned heuristics, memory-augmented frameworks, and hybrid approaches combining classical and learning-based techniques.

## 🚀 Future Directions

My future research aims to advance **foundation models and reinforcement learning** for more complex decision-making scenarios.

**Key directions:**
- Scaling LLM/VLM reasoning to longer horizons and multi-agent systems
- Sample-efficient RL for high-dimensional continuous control tasks
- Bridging the gap between learned policies and real-world deployment
