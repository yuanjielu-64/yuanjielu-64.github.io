# What I Do

I aim to build **intelligent navigation systems** that enable robots to operate autonomously in complex, unstructured environments‚Äîfrom disaster zones to dynamic indoor spaces.

## üî¨ Research Themes

### **Deep Learning & Reinforcement Learning for Robot Navigation**
Using RL and deep learning to enhance different components of the navigation stack‚Äîfrom perception and planning to control‚Äîcreating more robust and adaptive autonomous systems.

### **AI-driven Decision-Making for Motion Planning and Control**
Leveraging AI methods to enhance decision-making across motion planning and control.

### **LLMs and VLMs for Low-Level Decision-Making in Robot Navigation**
Investigating how LLMs and VLMs can be used for **direct low-level decision-making** in robot navigation. Rather than limiting foundation models to high-level reasoning, I explore their potential to generate immediate motion commands and reactive control actions.

### **Future Work: Legged & Humanoid Navigation**

My future research focuses on **navigation** (path planning and spatial reasoning) for legged robots, rather than **locomotion** (gait generation and motor control).

**Next challenges:**
- Quadruped climbing and navigation on non-planar terrain
- Humanoid robots: climbing obstacles and dynamic balance
- Integrating vision-based foothold selection with motion control

## ü§ñ Hardware Platforms

I work with diverse robot platforms to validate algorithms in simulation and reality:

| Robot | Type | Use Case |
|-------|------|----------|
| **Unitree Go2** | Quadruped | VLM navigation, cross-modal perception |
| **Unitree Go1** | Quadruped | Visual-LiDAR fusion, RL locomotion |
| **Unitree G1** | Humanoid | LLM-guided policy learning |
| **Clearpath Jackal** | Wheeled UGV | Real-world navigation testing |
| **Clearpath Husky** | Wheeled UGV | Outdoor mapping, multi-sensor fusion |
