I am a PhD candidate in Computer Science at George Mason University, advised by Prof. Xuesu Xiao. My research focuses on enabling autonomous robots to navigate reliably in complex, unstructured environments through novel motion planning algorithms and learning-based approaches.

## Research Interests
  * ***Deep Learning & Reinforcement Learning for Autonomous Robot Navigation***: Learning entire navigation stacks and individual subsystems for improved autonomy
  * ***Robot Motion Planning and Control***: Efficient algorithms for collision-free path planning and smooth motion execution
  * ***Large Language Models for Robotics Reasoning***: Integrating LLMs/VLMs for high-level reasoning and low-level planning and control
  * ***Machine Learning for Motion Planning***: Combining ML algorithms with traditional planners to improve planning efficiency and path quality
