I am a PhD candidate in Computer Science at George Mason University, advised by Prof. Xuesu Xiao. My research focuses on enabling autonomous robots to navigate reliably in complex, unstructured environments through novel motion planning algorithms and learning-based approaches.

## Research Interests
  * ***Deep Learning & Reinforcement Learning for Autonomous Robot Navigation***: Reinforcement learning algorithms (PPO, TD3), neural network-based trajectory prediction, imitation learning, adaptive policy learning for navigation
  * ***Robot Motion Planning and Control***: Dynamics-aware motion planning, sampling-based methods (PRM, RRT, DROMOS), hierarchical planning architecture, memory-augmented planning
  * ***Large Language Models for Robotics Reasoning***: LLM-guided parameter tuning, VLM-based perception and reasoning, chain-of-thought reasoning for decision-making, multimodal understanding for autonomous systems
  * ***Machine Learning for Motion Planning***: Ensemble learning approaches (XGBoost, LightGBM), predictive cost estimation, path feasibility learning, distributed training on HPC clusters
