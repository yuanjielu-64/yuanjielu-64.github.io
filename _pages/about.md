I am a PhD candidate in Computer Science at George Mason University, advised by Prof. Xuesu Xiao. My research focuses on enabling autonomous robots to navigate reliably in complex, unstructured environments through novel motion planning algorithms and learning-based approaches.

## Research Interests
  * ***Deep Learning & Reinforcement Learning for Autonomous Robot Navigation***
  * ***AI-driven Decision-Making for Robot Motion Planning and Control*** 
  * ***LLMs and VLMs for Low-Level Decision-Making in Robot Navigation***

## Recent Projects
### Adaptive Dynamics Planning (ADP) for Robot Navigation
*Combining classical motion planning with TD3-based reinforcement learning for real-time dynamics adaptation in constrained environments*
