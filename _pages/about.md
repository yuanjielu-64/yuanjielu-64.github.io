I am a PhD candidate in Computer Science at George Mason University, advised by Prof. Xuesu Xiao. My research focuses on enabling autonomous robots to navigate reliably in complex, unstructured environments through novel motion planning algorithms and learning-based approaches.

## Research Interests
  * ***Deep Learning & Reinforcement Learning for Autonomous Robot Navigation***: Learning-based approaches for adaptive navigation and decision-making in complex environments
  * ***Robot Motion Planning and Control***: Efficient algorithms for collision-free path planning and smooth motion execution
  * ***Large Language Models for Robotics Reasoning***: Integrating LLMs/VLMs for high-level reasoning and semantic understanding in robotic systems
  * ***Machine Learning for Motion Planning***: Applying ML techniques to accelerate planning through predictive modeling and experience reuse
